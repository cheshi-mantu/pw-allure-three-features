Today I'm starting a story about resolving test failures faster with Allure Report

[Audience:]

- It's a bloody report, that is built at the end of the pipeline!

[Egor:]

- NOT ANYMORE, jajajaja

			(laughs in Spanish)
- Shall we?

[Audience:] - People express agreement in German.

- Ja, Ja, Ja!

### Maybe you want logs only?

### Maybe you want history only?

### Maybe you want CSV, not HTML report?

### Maybe you want dashboards only?

### Add run details
